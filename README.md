Welcome to the Redux Counter app! This application demonstrates a simple counter implemented with React and managed using Redux. It allows users to increment, decrement, and reset the counter value.

## Overview

In this project, we have created a basic counter application using React for the UI and Redux for state management. The app consists of a counter display and three buttons: "Increment", "Decrement", and "Reset". Users can interact with these buttons to modify the counter value.

## Features

- **Increment Counter:** Increase the counter value by one.
- **Decrement Counter:** Decrease the counter value by one.
- **Reset Counter:** Reset the counter value to zero.
